# Hello ASP.NET!

This is a stripped back version of the ASP.NET template

## Your Project

There is no front-end!

This is a minimal project template that just returns the string "Hello Glitch!".
Change what this function returns to whatever you like.

- your app starts at `Program.cs`
- add nuget packages in `Website.csproj`
- safely store app secrets in `.env` (nobody can see this but you and people you invite)

Click `Show` in the header to see your app live. Updates to your code will instantly deploy.
